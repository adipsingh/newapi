        <p class="font-size-15 ls-0 lh-1-8 mb-30">Uploading and sending your large files should not be a time consuming hassle... Rather it should be easy, and fun. Attachmore fills the void between the size-limited upload attachment features of emails to the complex cumbersome swathe of online storage and FTP solutions.</p>
        <p class="font-size-15 ls-0 lh-1-8 mb-30">The Attachmore story began in 2006. Our founders foresaw the need for an easy to use, cost effective large file delivery service. The goal was to create a service that enhances a userâ€™s communication tools instead of replacing them. The end result was attachmore.com.</p>
        <p class="font-size-15 ls-0 lh-1-8 mb-30">Attachmore is self-funded and located in San Diego, California. We are a private company that is owned by its employees and answers early and often to its customers needs.</p>        
        <p class="font-size-15 ls-0 lh-1-8 mb-30">We encourage you to reach us directly for any product feedback or suggestions at <a href="" class="primary-500-fg" style="text-decoration: underline;">supportmore@attachmore.com</a>.
